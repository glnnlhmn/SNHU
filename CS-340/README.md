__Students will learn how to apply database systems concepts and principles to develop client/server applications that interface client-side code with databases.__

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

By using coding standards.  Personally, I like to use Black and flake8 to check my code formatting.  This applies industry standards to formatting the code base. Additionally, clear docstring and inline comments help to make the code more maintainable.  

### Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? 

This allows for the library to be used, developed, and tested separately from the dashboard. Additionally, the library can be used for more than one front end.  Applying CRUD principles supported data consistency.

### How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

This module could be used with any front end that requires access to the underlying MongoDB.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 

I like to explore the information available and consider the client's needs. This information can then be presented to the end user in a usable format. I believe this course did not actually discover anything that approaches data science. 

### Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 

In prior courses, I would guess exactly what a client might want. I would then try and improve the material to make the project a real learning experience. In this course, I just followed instructions as written and did not pretend to try and figure out what an actual client would have wanted. 

### What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

It depends on the client and the systems they currently have. 

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 

Turn data into information. 

### How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Lots of meetings to figure out what they really are looking to discover.
