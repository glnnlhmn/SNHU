### Responses to template questions

- Who was the client? <br>
```   
  Artemis Financial
```
- What issue did they want you to address? <br>
```   
  Find and correct potential security vulnerabilities
```
- What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities?<br>
``` 
  Discovered and document security considerations
  Refactored code to addres security concerns
  Evaluated dependencies with known issues
  Surpressed false positive dependency issues
```
Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?<br>

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?<br>
```
  I am much more familiar with the python flask framework then the spring framework
  The course seemed to assume a level of experience with Eclipse I do not have (I am a PyCharm user)
  The experience with the POM.xml file was useful
```  
How did you increase layers of security?<br>
```
  Added a certificate
  Wrote as hash algorithm to impliment SHA-256
```
In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?<br>
```
  Impliment the assessment learn in this course as part of the CI/CD pipeline
```
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure?<br>
```
  Testing
  Dependency check
```
After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?<br>
```
  Testing
```
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?<br>
```
  In retrospect I should have:
  
      Spent a few hours upfront create a "Hello World" project in the spring framework to become more familiar with the environement. 
      Forced the coding enviroment and change tracking into git
      Not limited my learning opportunity to what the class requires
     
```
