# Module One Assignment Guidelines

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Collecting requirements is an essential step in designing a system. It helps you understand your client&rsquo;s needs and gives you the right foundation for designing a system to meet those needs. Without this essential step, the system you design may not be useful for your client. This results in a waste of time and resources. There are many different ways that you might collect requirements from a client, but the goal is always the same: to understand what the client wants and needs. Then you will be able to design a system that meets those needs. In this assignment, you will begin working with the scenario and some of the documents for Project One. You will read through an interview transcript and begin the process of collecting requirements from the client, DriverPass. This will ensure that you have a good foundation as you work on Projects One and Two.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p>You work for a small consulting company that designs systems for various clients. Your project lead has assigned you to a new client, DriverPass. DriverPass wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. DriverPass wants your help in designing a system that can handle these needs. Your project lead, Jennifer, has recently assigned you to take over as the systems analyst for the DriverPass project. Your project lead (Jennifer) and the former system analyst for your company (Sam) conducted an interview with the boss (Liam) and IT officer (Ian) from DriverPass. Your project lead has given you a copy of the interview transcript. She would like you to review this transcript and then complete a portion of a business requirements document. This document is a way of communicating the client&rsquo;s needs, and your plan to meet those needs, back to your project lead. It will also support future steps in designing and developing the system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully read through the <strong>DriverPass Interview</strong> portion of the transcript. As you read, take notes on what the client needs. Think about the following questions as you read:</li>
<ul>
<li>What does the client want the system to do?</li>
<li>Who will be the different users of the system?</li>
<li>What will each user need to be able to do?</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Next, you will complete the <strong>System Components and Design</strong> portion of the Business Requirements Document. This is a high-level view of what the client needs from the system. Be sure to reference the interview transcript as you work to make sure you accurately capture your client&rsquo;s needs. You must complete the following sections:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This section should describe what your consulting company hopes to achieve with this project. Who is the client and what do they want their system to be able to do?</li>
<li><strong>System Background:</strong> In the interview transcript, DriverPass mentioned a problem that they see in society. What is the problem that they want to fix? DriverPass thinks they have a solution to this problem. What solution do they want to offer?<br />
<p>Tip: This section provides a &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; view of the needs. It&rsquo;s more focused on DriverPass as a company and their vision.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Objectives and Goals:</strong> You just described a &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; view of the system. Objectives and goals are a more specific breakdown of the things that the system should do. They break down the functionality that the system should have. The objectives should be measurable, which means that you should be able to tell whether you have completed each one.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: The business requirements document</strong> is part of Project One. You are <strong>only</strong> completing the <strong>System Components and Design</strong> section for this Module One assignment. The complete business requirements document will be a part of your submission for Project One, due in Module Five.</p>
