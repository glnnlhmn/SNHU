#### CS 255 Business Requirements 
<!-- 
This template lays out all the different sections that you need to complete for Project One. Each section has guiding questions to prompt your thinking. These questions are meant to guide your initial responses to each area. You are encouraged to go beyond these questions using what you have learned in your readings. You will need to continually reference the interview transcript as you work to make sure that you are addressing your client’s needs. There is no required length for the final document. Instead, the goal is to complete each section based on your client’s needs. 

Tip: You should respond in a bulleted list for each section. This will make your thoughts easier to reference when you move into the design phase for Project Two. One starter bullet has been provided for you in each section, but you will need to add more.
