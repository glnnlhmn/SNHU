### [System Analysis and Design](https://youtu.be/Kwf5wc2QCeE) 

Term: 23EW3

## Instructions

From **Project One**, submit the business requirements document. From **Project Two**, submit the system design document. Together, these documents showcase your work in system analysis and design. These documents demonstrate your ability to collect requirements from the customer and design a system that meets those needs.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It also will help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

#### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. 
- Who was the client? 
<br><br>
The company Driver Pass was an organization that provides driver training both online and in person. Students are individuals who are trying to get a drivers license. Services are provided by staff and also contracted instructors. <br><br>
- What type of system did they want you to design?
<br><br>
This was an hybrid that handles registration, payment, scheduling, and online courses. 
<br><br>
- What did you do particularly well?
<br><br>
I am happy with my ability to not allow scope creep in my assignments. 
<br><br>
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
<br><br>
I would spend more time working on the GitHub repo to create a better represnetation of the work. It would have been nice to storyboard the project. 
<br><br>
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
<br><br>
If the user is not happy the system fails.  If the system fails the developer goes nhungry!
<br><br>
- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
<br><br>
I like top down and then bottom up.  Take apart the system into components, the design the components. Personally, I like the agile model.  Spending time with the product owner and other vested individuals is a great place to start.
