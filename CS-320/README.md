# CS 320: 
## Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance

This repository was created to showcase my course work from my course at SNHU.  CS-320 was a good introduction to software testing therory and an introduction to junit testing. 

After completing this course I found this repo from [Randall Rowland](https://github.com/rowland007) which removed my viewpoint that I was unique in recording things this way. If you want to see an approach to the course check out thier [course work](https://github.com/rowland007/Grand-Strand-Systems).  

## Scenario

Detailed description of the senerio outlined captured for the [course material](https://github.com/glnnlhmn/SNHU/blob/main/CS-320/Scenario.md).

## Final Questions

In each CS class at SNHU they end with a few question that I am required to answer.  So to meet these requirements I wil answer them here. 

#### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Okay this might be a softball question. The course starts **Software Testing**.  To ensure my code works I need to test the code base. 

#### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I believe communication is the key to building good program that will be useful. Programmers would benifit not only learning the tools associated with coding and software testing, but also focus on good communication skills. 

#### How do I approach designing software?

I like to start at the top and discover the purposes and goals the user wants to achieve. Then dig into the  details and build it from the bottom up!
