# Course Reflections
As part of my assignment in this course I am required to write a reflection about the course. This is challenging for me because unlike all the people who want to write computer software my focus is on data analltics not cames and 3D user interfaces.  

## Positive Aspects
I struggled with the course but did learn how to utilize the resources available to me to get the work finished. Key contributers to me passing where:
- Professor Brian - he was great at proving additional support
- Dani - My academinc advisor who gave me the "speech" about getting things done
- Dee - My wife who supports me when I try and learn new things

## Required Items

1. How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  I found it interesting to utize the x-y-z coordinate system. It made much of linear algebra feel more concrete.
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I would create an object going for size, then I would rotate the object, finally I would position the object. 
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  The sequential approach to the software development is always helpful.  Code a little then test that is my motto.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  I applied the same top down bottom up strategy I use in problem solving.
- How did iteration factor into your development?
  I ran the program and made minot adjustment to get things where I wanted in the picture. 
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  My approach to development did not change in the course. 

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  This course did give me some insite to the capabilities of the GPU.  I can now appreciate the work that goes into making tools like Blender. 
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  I am sure I will see neat graphics and appreciate the work that goes into them. It might be interesting one day to create a real working #D database that people could did through to find items.
